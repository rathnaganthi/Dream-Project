## üîê Vision for Security

To ensure enterprise-grade security, we will implement a multi-layered approach combining Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), vulnerability scanning, patch management, access controls, and logging mechanisms.

## üß± Core Security Components

### 1. Endpoint Protection

* **Tool Examples**: Wazuh, OSSEC, CrowdStrike (Open source priority)
* **Purpose**: Real-time detection, threat hunting, and incident response.

### 2. Network Security

* **Firewall**: FortiGate (Fundamental & Associate certified experience)
* **NIDS/NIPS**: Suricata, Snort
* **VPN**: OpenVPN, WireGuard

### 3. Vulnerability Management

* **Tools**: OpenVAS, Nikto, Nessus Essentials (for learning)
* **Purpose**: Regular scanning and reporting of security gaps.

### 4. Patch Management

* **Tools**: WSUS (Windows), Ansible (Linux automation), Wazuh integration
* **Strategy**: Routine updates and automated patch deployments

### 5. IAM & Access Control

* **Active Directory Integration**: Role-based policies for user and admin access
* **2FA/SSO Integration**: Microsoft 365 & Identity Providers (Auth0, Okta - optional)

### 6. Logging & Monitoring

* **SIEM**: Wazuh + ELK Stack
* **Monitoring Tools**: Grafana + Prometheus

### 7. Cloud Security

* **AWS**: IAM roles, Security Groups, VPC, GuardDuty, Config
* **Azure**: Defender for Cloud, Conditional Access, Azure Policy

### 8. Backup and Recovery

* **Tools**: Veeam (optional), rsync, Restic, Proxmox backup
* **Practice**: Daily incremental + weekly full backups

## üìò Best Practices

* Regular audits and penetration testing
* Zero Trust security principles
* Least privilege access model
* Documentation for every policy change

---

## üìå Notes

* Preference for FOSS tools first
* Scalability and compliance focused (ISO 27001 alignment goal)
