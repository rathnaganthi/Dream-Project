# Infra Stack

This document outlines the foundational infrastructure tools and services selected for the Dream Project to support reliability, scalability, and automation.

---

## üß† Philosophy

Build with FOSS-first mindset. Ensure systems are modular, observable, and manageable from both CLI and dashboards. Focus on hybrid cloud-friendly architecture.

## üß∞ Core Infrastructure Components

### 1. Virtualization & Containers

* **Hypervisor**: Proxmox VE (on-premises)
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Container Management**: Portainer CE, optional Kubernetes in later phases

### 2. Networking

* **Switches**: VLAN-enabled D-Link (e.g., DGS-3130 series)
* **Firewall**: FortiGate 200F (HA-ready)
* **Routing**: Static + SD-WAN-ready

### 3. DNS & DHCP

* **Internal DNS**: Windows Server AD DNS, BIND (optional)
* **DHCP**: Windows DHCP or dnsmasq

### 4. Configuration & Automation

* **Automation Tool**: Ansible with AXE
* **Config Management**: GitLab CE with CI/CD workflows (YAML)
* **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault (future scope)

### 5. Monitoring & Observability

* **Metrics**: Prometheus
* **Dashboards**: Grafana
* **Log Collection**: Wazuh with ELK stack

### 6. Backup and Recovery
