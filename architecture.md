# 🏗️ Project Architecture – Dream Project

This document outlines the technical architecture of the Dream Project — a unified platform for both personal and professional use, integrating tools for task management, cybersecurity, network monitoring, productivity, and more.

---

## 🌐 1. Project Structure Overview

- **Frontend**: 
  - Built using **React** (optional Next.js for SSR)
  - TailwindCSS for UI design
  - Figma-based components for design consistency

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js with Express / Python FastAPI
  - REST API with modular routes (microservices ready)

- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL for structured data
  - MongoDB for semi-structured logs/events
  - Redis for caching and session storage

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Dockerized environment (Docker Compose for orchestration)
  - NGINX as reverse proxy
  - Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring

---

## 🔒 2. Security Modules

- **EDR & Vulnerability Management**: Integrated with Wazuh / OSSEC
- **Endpoint Hardening**: Policies via Ansible or scripts
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 / JWT-based access control
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack or Loki

---

## 📡 3. Network Monitoring Layer

- **Zabbix or Netdata**: Real-time monitoring
- **SNMP Integration**: For routers, switches, firewalls
- **Syslog Support**: Central logging with Wazuh / Graylog
- **Bandwidth & Latency**: Monitored and logged

---

## 🧠 4. AI & Analytics (Future Phase)

- Personal productivity suggestions using ML
- Behavioral anomaly detection
- Device health prediction
- Visual dashboards (Grafana with AI plugins)

---

## 📱 5. IoT & Device Integration (Optional Future)

- Health band sync (via Bluetooth APIs)
- Room sensor data logging
- Smart reminders (with personal context)

---

## 🧪 6. Dev & Test Strategy

- GitHub Actions / Jenkins CI for automation
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Static code analysis via SonarQube
- Canary deployments for experimental features

---

## 🧰 7. DevOps Stack

| Tool         | Purpose                 |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Docker       | Containerization        |
| Jenkins/GitHub Actions | CI/CD         |
| Ansible      | Infra automation        |
| Portainer CE | Docker management       |
| Proxmox VE   | Self-hosted VM layer    |
| Cloudflare   | DNS + Security gateway  |

---

## 📦 8. Modular App Components

- `task-manager/` — Task CRUD, timers, calendar
- `network-monitor/` — Dashboard for network stats
- `security-center/` — EDR alerts, logs, scan results
- `health-hub/` — Daily logs, reminders, metrics
- `settings/` — User and system configurations

---

## 📊 9. Data Flow Diagram (To Be Added)

_Include a simple architecture diagram here using draw.io or Excalidraw and export as image._

---

## 🔭 10. Future Possibilities

- Integration with Jamf for Apple devices
- OpenAPI documentation using Swagger
- Cloud-native transition (EKS, AKS, GCP Cloud Run)
- Mobile version (Flutter or React Native)
