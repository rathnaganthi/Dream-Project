# 🚀 Dream-Project – Roadmap

Welcome to the **Dream-Project**, a unified vision of personal and professional infrastructure — where IT, design, automation, monitoring, and daily routines come together in one powerful ecosystem.

## 🧭 Phase 0 – Vision & Research (Now–Aug 2025)

🎯 Goals:
- [x] Set up GitHub repository
- [x] Kickstart daily 6AM walking habit
- [ ] Focus research on real-world use cases and feasibility
- [ ] Define architecture and integration possibilities
- [ ] Draft UI/UX sketches and ideas in Figma or Markdown

💡 Example Modules:
- Admin Dashboard (for task, time, system, and routine tracking)
- Endpoint Detection & Protection (EDR/EDP)
- Network Monitoring (LAN + Internet)
- Vulnerability Management (risk, patch cycle)
- Personal Health & Habit Tracker
- Integration with devices (e.g. wearables, NAS, self-hosted tools)
- Central Design + Dev Flow (Figma ↔ GitHub ↔ Docker)

🎯 Goals:
- [ ] Build and test 1–2 functional modules
- [ ] Start internal use + documentation process
- [ ] Create step-by-step setup guides
- [ ] Align design → code workflow using GitHub & Figma sync

🔁 Example Workflow:

- _update you shorltly_

## 💡 Long-Term Vision

> **“If life is the operating system — this project is the control panel.”**

This isn’t just about tech — it’s about solving problems you’ve faced every day:
- Managing tasks, systems, and health in one place
- Designing a lifestyle and toolchain that supports growth
- Building something bigger than code — a movement
